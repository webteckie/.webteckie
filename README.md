# Exciting Software Moments
This is a collection of those moments in my software career that made an impact on where I am today!

## High School: my after-school programming teacher
This is how it all started! All I can remember was his name Bob. Bob was a computer teacher at Boston's BAHEC(BOSTON AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER) an after school program for kids that were interested or needed extra help in math and sciences. For me it was really a way to keep off the streets at the time. Once in the program and out of curiosity I decided to join Bob's computer class. Never had used a computer before, let alone program anything. It all started with a drawing program on a very old computer (Amiga?). I quickly became amazed that by inputing some values through the keyboard I could draw lines in the screen :-) Eventually I graduated to using simple programming commands. And I went from curiousity to addiction. Bob was super instrumental to me at the time and laid the foundation for my profesional software engineering career!
